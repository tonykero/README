# Antoine Karcher

Hello, I am a french engineer.

I am interested in developing my skills in:
- High Performance Computing (Parallel & Distributed & Heterogenous Computing)
- Formal Verification (Theorem Provers & Compilers)
- Numerical Simulation

I started lots of projects to learn things but dropped most of them too.  
So for now my repositories are not as interesting as I wanted them to be.

In the future you **may** or **may not** see some of the following projects appear on my Github:
- SMT Solver (See [Z3], [CVC5])
- Non-turing complete functional language (See [Charity], [TFP])
- ...
